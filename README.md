This repository is intended to store my progress from intermediate to advanced level.

1 FIRST PROJECT: Simple ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) (YOU CAN FIND IT ON "ETL" FOLDER)

STEPS:
    1 Read a large CSV file (e.g., sales or customers).
    2 Process data (correct nulls, standardize dates, remove duplicates).
    3 Load the cleaned data into a SQL database (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL).
    4 Additional: Save in another format (Parquet or JSON).

    For this project i'm using a dataset (csv) obtained on Kaggle, you can find it on the link below.
    https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitgrewal/netflix-data

    There's about 7.000 rows, i dubled it to make it larger, with the purpose of making it harder to work on it.
